- 🐛 **Installation Scripts**: Corrected dependency verification logic in setup scripts to prevent false negatives.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-03

### Added
- ✅ **Model Manager & Caching**: Central `ModelManager` for sharing a single Whisper/faster-whisper model instance across single, batch, and realtime modes, eliminating repeated load delays.
- ✅ **Distil-Whisper Models**: Support for `distil-medium.en` and `distil-large-v2` for significantly faster English transcription.
- ✅ **Realtime Buffering**: Deque-based buffering for smoother, low-latency realtime transcription and reduced CPU overhead.
- ✅ **Benchmark Suite**: `benchmark_insightron.py`, sample audio, and `benchmark_results.json` to measure performance across models and modes.

### Changed
- 🔄 **Batch Processing**: Batch mode now reuses a shared model instance for all files to maximize throughput.
- 🔄 **Decoding Strategy**: Smarter beam search defaults with dynamic beam size tuned for either speed or accuracy.
- 🔄 **Configuration**: `config.yaml` extended with model, device, and compute-type options aligned with the new Model Manager.
- 🔄 **Architecture**: Project modularized into `core`, `transcription`, `realtime`, `gui`, `setup`, `scripts`, and `tests` for clearer separation of concerns.

### Technical Details
- Added a centralized `ModelManager` used across CLI, GUI, batch, and realtime pipelines.
- Updated `config.yaml` schema to capture model preferences, device selection, and compute type (e.g., INT8).
- Refactored core logic from `insightron.py` into dedicated modules under `core/`, `transcription/`, and `realtime/`.
- Introduced benchmarking flow that generates test audio, runs single, batch, and realtime simulations, and saves metrics to JSON.
